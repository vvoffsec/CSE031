TPS1:

1. The text segment is 0x00400000 and the data segment is 0x10010000
2. In the basic one, it looks like it is showing the true instructions, whilst the source has some more human-readable instructions.
3. There are 4 bytes between the address locations.
4. There are 8 columns.
5. Each columns has 4 bits where as the addresses have 32 bits between them.
6. m: .word 20
7. M was stored at 0x10010004
8. str1: .asciiz "I love CSE31!"
9. 0x10010008 - 0x10010014
10. o l   I, C   e v, 1 3 E S, This DOES match with how an array of characters is stored.
11. la     $a0, str1
    li      $v0, 4
    syscall
12. la will load the address of n into $t3 (la = load address)

TPS2:

1. By having less comparisons, the program ultimately runs faster since there are less operations happening.
