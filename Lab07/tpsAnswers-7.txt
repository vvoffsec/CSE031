TPS1:

1. A method is a function that is exclusive to a class. A function returns a value. A procedure does not return values, but works similarly to functions.
2. done
3. done
4. Line 12 is the line where a jump is used to go to Line 20, where registers are added and the value is loaded into $v0.
5. You cannot use j $ra because the code is meant to read a label, not a register. jr $ra is used to read registers.
6. The return address is at line 11, and is saved to $ra. The value there, however, is 0, which does not make much sense.
7. There is an error: "Invalid program counter value".
8. It should be the line after the original jump was called
9. It should be correct.
10. The new return address is: 0x0040001c, and the output is 15.
11. jal should be the correct operator to use.
12. done

TPS2:

1. The output should be 38.
2. It'll be an infinite loop.
3. jal allows for the program to go to the register that is specified and then save the return address at $ra. When it is called again within sum, the original return address is lost.
4. We can save the original value of $a0 by doing: addi $sp, $sp, 4.
5. The original value of $s0 is replace by the value of m. This may pose a problem because the program does not necessarily account for this.
6. done
