4. li $v0, 5
   syscall
   add $t3, $0, $v0
5. You do not need to declare n, lw, or la.
6. done

TPS2:

1. When I enter 5, I get 29 as an output.
2. done
3. done
4. $a0
5. It will be returned into $v0. Since it is easy to move this value from $a0, moving it to $v0 to make the correct syscall is trivial.
6. done
7. There is enough space for 3 ints. It is not reserving any space for ints right now.
8. done
9. done
10. We need to keep track of the size of the number since it is summing the values.
11. done
12. It won't have the right value for $a0. We need to restore the original value.
13. done
14. done
15. It is the return address from the first time the recursive function was called.
