TPS 2: 

1. .word is used to allocate space in memory. .text tells the code when to go to the next text segment, or rather just
denoting where the code starts. .data is where a variable is initialized.
2. if $t3 == $0, then go to the finish and execute from there, if not then continue with fib.
3. Since the fibonacci sequence is recursive, it calls itself by using the j (jump) operator and runs again.
4. Go to the execute tab, find line 15, and click the checkbox in the bkpt column, but do not assemble after doing this. 
To step through the program, click the step button from the top dropdown under "Run".
5. On the right side of the screen, there is a window with a tab named registers with all of the values showing there.
6. To edit a register while the program is running, first have a breakpoint in the execute tab selected, then while the program
is running, double click on the value for a register and edit it to any value.
7. 0x10010000 
8. Using $t0 and the number for syscall.
