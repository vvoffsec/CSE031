Individual Assignment 1:

1. Line 25 is causing the error
2. I fixed it by dereferencing the input variable.
3. "Sum" isn't being updated in for the read_values.
4. I fixed it by making sum a pointer.

Individual Assignment 2:

1. The output is expected. I get "HELLO!hello!" as the output.
2. The output is not expected. I get "HI!hi!hello!". I fixed the code by adding
the length of string one to the length of string two in the for loop.
3. The output is not expected. This might have happened because string 1 and 2 have a size of 10 in the main function, and the input that we are giving into the function is much more than 10.
