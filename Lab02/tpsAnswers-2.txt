TPS2:

1. clang -g punishment.c -o punishment
2. lldb ./punish
3. process launch
4. run
5. breakpoint set --file punishment.c --line 26
6. 
    To run the code line-by-line, I used "step"
    I showed the variable contents by doing:
        p typoLine
        p i 
        p count
7. To finish through the program, I used "continue"
8. To get out of lldb, I used "exit"

TPS3:

1. There are 4 variables, with 2 of them being pointers.
2. X, Y, and Arr[0] will all be random values.
3. This can be fixed by setting the values of all of the variables.
4. done.
5. They are equal.
6. done
7. done
8. The addresses of the first element and the actual array are the same because they point to the same memory place. This does make sense based on the previous exercises.
