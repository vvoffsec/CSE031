1. How to Open a terminal from my PC?
    I can use Windows+R and type "cmd" to open a non-admin instance. I can also just look it up in the Windows Search bar. I can also use PowerShell for administrative terminals
    a.) Can you open more than 1 terminal?
        Yes
    b.) Why do you think you want to make more than 1 terminal?
        In the case that a program is connected to another or is dependent on another program (awaiting input from one program to the other)
2. How can you tell what the contents of your directory is?
    By using the command "ls" in PowerShell
3. How can you navigate to the Desktop directory?
